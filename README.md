# Myntra Hackerramp 2024 - Innov Her Team
Welcome to the repository for our project developed during the Myntra Hackerramp 2024!

## Overview
Our project features two innovative components aimed at enhancing the shopping experience on Myntra:

1. Movie Costume Feature
Explore and purchase costumes and accessories inspired by your favorite movie characters. This feature allows users to easily find and buy authentic character costumes directly from the website, making it easier than ever to dress up as beloved characters.

2. AR Home Decor Feature
Reimagine your living space with our augmented reality (AR) home decor feature. While shopping for home decor items, users can view how each item would look in their own home through an AR interface. This feature helps customers make more informed decisions by visualizing decor items in their actual space before purchasing.
